This is "imerge", Kernighan's & Pike's "idiff" program out of their
fabulous book "The UNIX Programming Environment" (Prentice-Hall 1984).

In short, imerge runs a diff on two files and asks interactively
for each delta which variant should go into a third, merged file.

I typed in the little C program directly from the book back in 1986
or some such.  I just noticed today (2000) that the entire code of
the book is now available through the Internet.  (It didn't float
around on Usenet back then.)  The copyright in the package says:

In since I didn't apply significant changes to the code this still
is all which applies.  Have fun with it.

Not after hesitating for a some time, I took liberty to change the name
when I wrote program and man page.  I think "imerge" captures the
purpose of the tool so much better and I still think "man -k" should be
enough to save day.

Sooner or later, I took imerge/idiff with me wherever I had to do some
work, without changing anything much.  It's now  CVS'ed for easier
accessibility.

Use the repository :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.gaertner.de:/usr/local/cvs with
password "cvs" to check for any updates.   Which are unlikely, though.
These AT&T folks sure were able to avoid version numbers other than
"1.0".  And I'm not intending to break with this fine tradition where
not necessary.
