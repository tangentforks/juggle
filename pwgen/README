This is "pwgen", a simple-as-can-be random password/token/identifier
generator.

public domain for any use, no restrictions apply.

For installation,
(1) adjust the proper destination paths in the Makefile,
(2) enable the #define in the source if your Unix supports
    a /dev/random pseudo device and you think you really need
    this feature [note that reading from that device can be slow]
(3) run "make", check it out
(4) run "make install"

That's all, folks.
