<TR valign="baseline"><TD><H1>DDE Conversations</h1>
<TR><TD colspan="2"> 


<p>There are three types of DDE conversations, known as <i>hot</i>, <i>warm</i> and <i>cold</i>: 
<p>
<li>in a hot link, the client asks that whenever some data changes, the server send it 
the new data.<br><br>

<li>in a warm link, the client asks that whenever some data changes, the server send it 
an indication that the data has changed (but not the new data itself). <br><br>

<li>in a cold link, the server never notifies the client whenever data has changed. 
<p>
Programs to handle each of these will be slightly different, and you will need to know what type of conversation the other application supports.

<p>
Hot and warm links are also known as <i>advise loops</i>.

<p>
A warm link is essentially a combination of a hot and cold link - the hot link advises 
of a change in the data item, the cold link is used to send the data item.

<p>
A conversation uses three identifiers: <i>service</i>, <i>topic</i> and <i>item</i>. A conversation may also 
move <i>data</i>:
<p> 
<li><b>service</b> 	identifies the server application, and is typically set by the server<br>
<li><b>topic</b> 	is a high level identifier of the information being exchanged<br>
<li><b>item</b> 	is a low level identifier of the information being exchanged<br>
<li><b>data</b> 	is the data being exchanged (as character data)

<p>
Service, topic, and item names are case-insensitive.

<p>
Some applications require specific topic and item names be used; others do not care. A 
commonly used topic is the <i>system</i> topic, which may also have a <i>sysitems</i> item, both are 
used to provide information about a server application to a client. For example, Lotus 
123 for Windows has a system topic:

<pre>
   wd 'ddereq 123w system sysitems'
SysItems Topics Formats RangeNames Selection Status

   wd 'ddereq 123w system status'
Ready
</pre>

<p>
Some applications such as spreadsheets allow data to be exchanged in clipboard 
format. The utility <code>clipfmt</code> in script <b>format.ijs</b> will convert a list or table into clipboard 
format.

<p>
With spreadsheets, it is typical for the topic to be the worksheet name, and the item to 
be the cell or range name. For example, suppose <code>data</code> is a table of shape two by three, 
then this could be written to an Excel worksheet <code>sheet1</code> as follows:

<pre>
   txt=. clipfmt data
   wd 'ddepoke excel sheet1 r1c1:r2c3 *',txt
</pre>

<p>
Some servers support a DDE <i>execute</i> command, allowing the client to use the server's 
command language directly. However, servers that support execute usually do so only in 
the system topic, and then only in a limited fashion, for example to run menu commands 
such as File/Open. For non-trivial tasks it is usually best to create a macro in the 
application and then use the execute command to run the macro. Most applications 
follow the conventions for execute expressions indicated in the following:

<pre>
   [open(&quot;sample.xlm&quot;)]
   [run(&quot;r1c1&quot;)]
   [connect][download(query1,results.txt)][disconnect]
</pre>
