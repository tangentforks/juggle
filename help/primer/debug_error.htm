<TR valign="baseline"><TD><H1>Debug - an error</h1><TR><TD>

<P>Let's introduce an error into your <TT>centigrade </TT>verb to see how that looks and how you would find and fix it.</P>

<P>Open your cf.ijs script and edit the first line to have an error by adding quotes around the expression to the right of the copula.</P>

<PRE>t1 =. 'y. - 32'
</PRE>
<P>Instead of <TT>t1 </TT>being defined as the result of <TT>y. - 32 </TT>, it will be defined as the string </P>
<PRE>'y. - 32' .
</PRE>
<P>Run the script to make the new definition. Turn off debug suspension and request no stops and then run your buggy <TT>centigrade</TT>. Be sure to load the debug utilities if they are not already loaded.</P>

<PRE>   dbr 0	NB. disable suspension
   dbss ''
   centigrade 212
¦domain error
¦   t2=.t1    *5
</PRE>
<P>You are executing with suspension disabled (<TT>dbr 0</TT>) so execution did not suspend in centigrade and you have the normal 3 space indent.</P>

<P>If you look at the line in error it is clear that the 5 is a valid argument to times, so there must be something wrong with <TT>t1</TT>. But you don't know the value of <TT>t1</TT>. You could stare at the source for the error, but, in a complex situation, it might be quicker to use debug. </P>

<P>Enable suspension and rerun.
</P>
<PRE>   dbr 1	NB. enable suspension
   centigrade 212
¦domain error
¦   t2=.t1    *5
¦centigrade[1]
</PRE>
<P>There is a 6 space indent indicating suspension, and because <TT>centigrade </TT>is suspended you can look at the value of t1.</P>

<PRE>      t1
y. - 32
</PRE>
<P>From the display of t1 it is clear that it is a string, not the number from the desired calculation. You can now look at the source to see where <TT>t1 </TT>was defined and see that the quotes should not be there.</P>

<P>Edit the source to fix the definition by removing the quotes and run the script to redefine <TT>centigrade</TT>.</P>

<P>You want to run line 0 again to properly define <TT>t1</TT>. You can do this by using <TT>dbnxt </TT>to continue execution at line 0.</P>

<PRE>      dbjmp 0
100

</PRE><P>Since no stops are set and there are no other errors, line 0 of <TT>centigrade </TT>is executed, which sets a proper value into local <TT>t1 </TT>and execution continues until finished.</P>
