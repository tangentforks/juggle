Language used:  J

	J is a dialect of APL, supporting functions that are applied to
	lists containing numbers and strings, and higher-order operators,
	including user-defined ones, that are applied to functions or pairs
	of functions.  It is an interpreted language and, as per ICFP-1998,
	already officially "cool".

Task Scope:

	Tier - 0.5 to 1 (we are using fuzzy logic)

Algorithm used:

	Do the basic parsing, then surrender to the rendering.	The ultra
	high speed rendering engine uses a lot of energy.  It usually
	drains also some power of the light sources.   The resulting
	images may therefore be a bit darker then usual, but performance
	should be very good.
