ICFP 2000 Team Juggle Trial Assignment

(This information is also available as http://juggle.gaertner.de/icfp/ )

The city of Braunschweig has a public transsportation system
with busses and street cars.

Unlike the London bus schedule (which just says: "there might
come a bus around here, maybe once every hour.  Eventually.  Perhaps.")
well, UNLIKE the London schedule, the Braunschweig one promises
service exact to the minute.

The trial contest assignment is to work on the original raw schedule
data as of 1996.  This is real data.

You should have the data in icfp/trial/bus when checked out via cvs (use
compression!).  Alternatively, you could get
http://juggle.gaertner.de/icfp/bus.tar.gz    or
http://juggle.gaertner.de/icfp/bus.zip

The ".dat" files will contain the real data, the corresponding ".txt" files
some hints what the columns means.

The assignment has two parts:

Part 1:

The assignment is find the latest (direct or indirect) connections
going from stop A to stop B, given the date and time of arrival at B.

The program shall read from stdin three lines per query:

1. origin stop A
2. destination stop B
3. arrival time at B

Stops are given by their long or short name.
All dates and times will be encoded as YYYY-MM-DD:HH.MM

Output shall be the up to five latest connections *LEAVING* A still
coming in time, all of them leaving less than an hour earlier than the
latest possible connection.
For each connection, identify when and where to enter and leave
a bus.

Contest criteria would be first the quality of the 10 results,
next the CPU time used (as per system(1)).

Part 2:

Devise an info system reading short HTTP GET requests on stdin and answering
with HTML output.  The output should give an answer to the reqest and
links and/or forms for further related or unrelated queries.
The info system should be startable by a

	GET start

request.

Contest criteria would be "usefulness".

Have fun.
