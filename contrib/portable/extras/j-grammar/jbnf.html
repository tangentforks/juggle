One of the recent questions on the J Forum mailing was:

Is there any standard BNF grammar for J available?

The Backus-Naur-Form (initially called "Backus-Normal-Form") is the classical
formal device used to define the grammars of programming languages since the
hey days of Algol60.  A BNF grammar defines concisely all syntactically
legal programs, often imposing some semantic structure on the program at
the same time.  For example, grammars can already imply the precedence rules
expressions, although that often goes along with fanciful abstract constructs
such as in:

<pre>
	expr =: mult-expression '+' mult-expression
	      | mult-expression '-' mult-expression

	mult-expression =: factor-term '*' factor-term
	                 | factor-term '%' factor-term
			 | factor-term

	factor-term =: primary '^' primary  |  primary

	primary =: constant  |  variable | '(' term ')'
</pre>

Anyway, even if you've never heard the acronym "BNF" before, this
should give you the idea what we are looking for in this article.
If you happen to think of "railroad diagrams", you are thinking along
the right track, too.

Back to the question:

It is a conmmon question, in particular because so many other
programming languages define their grammars through a BNF.
Many programmers would know how to find their ways around in
a J phrase if they had a BNF at hand.  They could also quickly
check where they went astray when faced with a "syntax error".

As it happens, there is no BNF for J given in the Dictionary.
The control structures are all given in a very BNF-like notation,
but there is nothing like that for expression level; that is,
phrases formed with nouns, verbs, adverbs, and conjunctions.

Instead, there are a handful or rules in informal language, such
as "An adverb acts on a single noun or verb to its <i>left</i>."
These are accompagnied by the so-called "operational semantics"
how some possible abstract (or real) J engine might deal with
the various J constructs.

When I was wading through this definition of J, I was wondering
if it would be possible to summarize all this in a neat little
aequivalent BNF grammar.  It took me quite some time to find the
answer:

No.

The reason for this is that J by definition intertwines parsing
and execution.  Whereas all syntactical questions in Pascal program
can be answered statical before the program is executed, this cannot
be said for J.

For a start, consider this expression with
functions and arguments in Pascal:

<pre>
	a(b, c(d, e));
</pre>

and the corresponding line in J:

<pre>
	b a d c e
</pre>

The additional syntactical overhead in Pascal an essential help
to tell functions from variable arguments already on formal grounds.
In J, a mere "b a d c e" alone tells us nothing.  We have to do some
research to discern a function name from a data name, and only then
we start to sort out the syntactical structure.  Any static analysis
is finally completely swarted by the possibility to have "d" above
merrily change between being bound to a noun or to a verb.  Hence
we cannot even resolve the monad/dyad ambiguity of "c" statically.
