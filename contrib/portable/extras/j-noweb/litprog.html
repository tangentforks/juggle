<p>
The integrated creation of program source and its documentation is
called <def>literate programming</def>.  This term goes back to
Donald Knuth and his "WEB" system, a literate programming system
for Pascal.
<p>
This article describes my first experiences with using Norman
Ramsey's "noweb" system for J programming.  We also take a look at
a few other approaches to create nice representations of J code.
<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Perhaps interestingly, I took my first look at noweb when I
wrote my first Vector article.  I already had all the J coding
done, and I just wanted to document it for Vector readers.  Rather
than starting a new text document and including some source snippets
via cut and paste, I extended the original J script file with
additional text material.
<p>
Keeping the source code and its documentation in the same file is
the central idea behind literate programming.  This way it becomes
easy to maintain these two aspects of a program consistently.  As
the old adage says:  nothing is more misleading than outdated
comments and incorrect documentation.  By tying the code and all its
documentation closely together, literate programming makes it easier
to keep both in sync.
<p>
The unified source is then filtered in different ways for different
purposes.  One can either extract the program code for the compiler
or, as is the case with J, the interpreter; or, alternatively, pull
out the documentation with embedded code fragments to be nicely
typeset.
<p>
Noweb is a freely available WEB cousin written by Norman Ramsey.
The web site
<a href=http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/>
http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/</a>
is the home page of the system.  Noweb's main characteristics are
simplicity and language-independency.  It is available for all J
platforms and already comes as an installable package with all of
the free Unix/Linux distributions.  All in all, enough reasons for
me to give it a serious try with a few small J projects.
<p>
The following are the main tools of the noweb system:
<dl>
<dt>notangle
<dd>extracts just the source code proper from the literate program,
i.e. a J script.
<p>
<dt>noweave
<dd>extracts documentation with embedded code prepared for some
typesetting program such as TeX/LaTeX, troff, or an HTML browser;
it optionally creates and formats cross references along the way.
</dl>
<p>
Noweb supports a handful of programming languages and typesetting
backends out of the box.  For the use with J, I provided a very
simple recogniser for declarations in order to get the cross
referencer working.  One could give explicit hints with each
code chunk about the defined objects but an automatic recogniser
is much more convenient.
<p>
Since I deemed only global definitions at the module level worthwhile
to be indexed, this was easy.  A single regular expression was all
I needed, namely <code>^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+ *=:</code>.  This pattern matches all
assignments to J names at the beginning of a line.  I always indent
J sentences within a verb definition, a style that in my opinion
makes a script more digestable for both human readers and such
simplistic analysers alike.
<p>
Noweb's way of integration of such tools is straightforward.  One
just needs to provide a text filter operating on a common intermediate
format.
<p>
All in all, a 20-line <code>awk</code> script takes care of definition recognition,
index collection, and some other amenities like using <code>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;=</code> for
the continuation of the previous code chunk without spelling
out its name again.
<p>
<h2>A Simple Example</h2>
<h3>Input (aka: The Source)</h3>
<p>
Here is a simple example.  First, a noweb input file with some
documented J code, presumably stored as <code>stat.nw</code>:
<p>
<xmp>
<<statistics>>=
  <<auxiliaries>>
  <<averages>>
@
Averages are coming in various forms.
There is the well-known [[mean]] function,
for a start:
<<averages>>=
mean=:sum % #
@
The geometric mean is another one:
<<averages>>=
geomean=: # %: prod
@
This works with the help of
some aggregating functions:
<<auxiliaries>>=
sum=: +/
prod=: */
</xmp>
<p>
See how code chunks start or are continued with names in
double angle brackets.  Documentation mode is entered with
a single "@" character.  Embedded code in documentation
is written in double square brackets.
<p>
<h3>Output 1:  The Code</h3>
<p>
The command
<pre>
notangle -t8 -Rstatistics -filter emptydefn stat.nw &gt; stat.ijs
</pre>
will extract the J script file <code>stat.ijs</code>.  It will look like this:
<p>
<xmp>
  sum=: +/
  prod=: */
  mean=:sum % #
  geomean=: # %: prod
</xmp>
<p>
The <code>-Rstatistics</code> option tells noweave to start extraction at
the root node <code>statistics</code>.  This node is then expanded from
its arbitrarily large tree of sub nodes.  The important things
to note about the nodes are:
<ol>
<li>You can extract different code parts, i.e., different J scripts,
from one and the same noweb source.
<li>The order of the extracted code can very well be different
from the order in the noweb source which is typically the one deemed
most suitable for a lucid presentation.
</ol>
<p>
<h3>Output 2:  The Documentation</h3>
<p>
The command
<pre>
<a name="NWD1">noweave -html stat.nw &gt; stat.html</a>
</pre>
creates the documentation variant of the file.  It can generate
TeX, LaTeX, troff, and HTML markup out of the box.
When viewed with your browser, you'd see roughly the following,
including the font changes:
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre><a name="NWlitA-staA-1" href="#NWD1"><dfn>&lt;statistics&gt;=</dfn></a>
  <a name="NWlitA-staA-1-u1" href="#NWD4"><i>&lt;auxiliaries&gt;</i></a>
  <a name="NWlitA-staA-1-u2" href="#NWD2"><i>&lt;averages&gt;</i></a>
</pre><blockquote>Defines <a href="#NWI-geomean"><code>geomean</code></a>, <a href="#NWI-mean"><code>mean</code></a>, <a href="#NWI-prod"><code>prod</code></a>, <a href="#NWI-sum"><code>sum</code></a> (links are to index).<p>
</blockquote><p><p>
<a name="NWD2">Averages are coming in various forms.</a>
There is the well-known <code><a href="#NWD1">mean</a></code> function,
for a start:
<pre><a name="NWlitA-ave8-1" href="#NWD2"><dfn>&lt;averages&gt;=</dfn></a> <b>(<a href="#NWD1">&lt;-U</a>)</b> <b>[D<a href="#NWD3">-&gt;</a>]</b>
<a href="#NWD1">mean</a>=:<a href="#NWD1">sum</a> % #
</pre><blockquote>Defines <a href="#NWI-mean"><code>mean</code></a> (links are to index).<p>
</blockquote><p><p>
<a name="NWD3">The geometric mean is another one:</a>
<pre><a name="NWlitA-ave8-2" href="#NWD2"><dfn>&lt;averages&gt;+=</dfn></a> <b>(<a href="#NWD1">&lt;-U</a>)</b> <b>[<a href="#NWD2">&lt;-</a>D]</b>
<a href="#NWD1">geomean</a>=: # %: <a href="#NWD1">prod</a>
</pre><blockquote>Defines <a href="#NWI-geomean"><code>geomean</code></a> (links are to index).<p>
</blockquote><p><p>
<a name="NWD4">This works with the help of</a>
some aggregating functions:
<pre><a name="NWlitA-auxB-1" href="#NWD4"><dfn>&lt;auxiliaries&gt;=</dfn></a> <b>(<a href="#NWD1">&lt;-U</a>)</b>
<a href="#NWD1">sum</a>=: +/
<a href="#NWD1">prod</a>=: */
</pre><blockquote>Defines <a href="#NWI-prod"><code>prod</code></a>, <a href="#NWI-sum"><code>sum</code></a> (links are to index).<p>
</blockquote><p><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The same command with a few additional options will create
hyperjumps and indexes for chunk names and definitions:
<pre>
noweave -html -filter autodefs.ijs -index  stat.nw &gt; stat.html
</pre>

to experience that version of this article.
<p>
Many references created by noweave are marked as "U" or "D", pointing
to uses and definitions of the named code nodes or global J names.
<p>
The text sections in a noweb source can also use any markup commands
appropriate for the noweave backend used.  If you want to have chapter
headings or bulleted lists in your documentation, this is the way
to go.
<p>
With the output generated for the heavy-duty typesetting programs
LaTeX or troff, you can make a high-quality booklet or even tome.
The cross-references will go into the page margin, of course with
the proper page references.  I stumbled over noweb when I read the
following gem:  <it>A Retargetable C Compiler: Design and
Implementation</it> by C. Fraser and D. Hanson -- 592 pages
noweb-based compiler source and documentation in finest typography.

<p>
<h2>Nitty-gritty Details</h2>
<p>
Knuth's original WEB tool was tailored to Pascal and TeX.  (It was actually
written to overcome some of Pascal's short-comings:  the lack
of a module system and the very strict order of definitions in a standard
Pascal program.)
The good thing about noweb is that it can be used with any source language
and generate output for different text processing systems.
<p>
<a name="NWD5">While the J code excerpt shown above is digestable by J, you don't</a>
want to touch it ever again.  For example, if you have to fix a
bug, you should do this in the <code>stat.nw</code> file, not in
<code>stat.ijs</code> produced by <code>notangle</code>.  Likewise, there is little use to put
<code>stat.ijs</code> under version control.
<p>
I have therefore written my little <code>load</code> variant <code>loadnw</code> which
notangles a script on the fly and loads the output:
<p>
<pre><a name="NWlitA-loa6-1" href="#NWD5"><dfn>&lt;loader&gt;=</dfn></a>
NB. [chunkname] loadnw filename
NB. *loads a node from a noweb file.
<a href="#NWD5">loadnw_z_</a> =: verb define
        '*' loadnw y.
:
        0!:100 (2!:0) 'notangle -t8 ''-R', x., ''' -filter emptydefn ', y.
)
</pre><blockquote>Defines <a href="#NWI-loadnw_z_"><code>loadnw_z_</code></a> (links are to index).<p>
</blockquote><p><p>
The chunk name <code>*</code> used as default left argument here is noweb's
default root node.  You'll often find noweb files just containing
one or more <code>&lt;&lt;*&gt;&gt;</code> chunks and no further sub-nodes.
<p>
The option to extract different code parts from a script also comes in
very handy for test code.  Users of the library just want to get the
definitions from the script.  But when I work on the script, it helps
to have an additional test chunk executed which prepares and runs
some initial tests.
The library code is defined as a subordinate node to the test node
so that I can choose which version to extract from the script by
specifying the corresponding root node.  Noweb is effectively taking
the role of a classic "conditional preprocessor" when used in this
style.
<p>
Unfortunately, J will report errors with a line count referring
just to the extracted code.  It would be really helpful if the line
number could refer properly to the noweb source file.  After all,
this is where the fix has to be made.  Noweb can indicate the proper
source coordinates in its notangled output.  By default, it uses
C preprocessor-style <code>#line 123 stat.nw</code> directives but it can
generate any other syntax as appropriate for the programming language
used.  It would be really helpful if J could take such a hint --
not just for working with noweb but for any other code generator
as well.
<p>
The <code>nountangle</code> utility is a variant of <code>notangle</code>.  It creates
a program, too, but keeps the full documentation as block comments
in the extracted code.  <code>Nountangle</code> needed to be extended to
support J's <code>NB.</code> syntax.  As luck has it, it is a shell script
on Unix, so this was very simple to arrange.
<p>
<h2>Comparisons with Other Approaches</h2>
<p>
<h3>Plain Old Comments</h3>
<p>
Lines prefixed with <code>NB.</code>s are easy to ignore in small doses.
Beyond a dozen lines, the letters can begin to irritate readers.
Longer documentation also benefits from decent typesetting.  After
all, you seldom see a Vector article only consisting of <code>NB</code>'ed
code.
<p>
Just for improved readability, I've seen some people using
literate noun scripts to include one or more paragraphs of
comments in a script.  This runs as follows:
<p>
<xmp>
0 : 0
todayno:  converts dates to day numbers.
Method is to subtract dates on a calendar basis to determine
integral number of months plus the exact number of days remaining.
This is converted to payment periods, where # days remaining are
calculated as: (# days)%365
)
</xmp>
<p>
The script containing the notes is simply parsed and
immediately discarded again.  Without any leading <code>NB</code> letters,
it is readable with less distraction than ordinary comment blocks.
<p>
<h3>Scriptdoc</h3>
<p>
J/Windows comes with the <code>scriptdoc</code> utility.
It will extract traditional <code>NB.</code> comments written according
to some scriptdoc-specific markup conventions.  Basically,
you just have to put an asterisk and a one-letter code in
a strategic place.
<p>
The comments list the names of the routines, their typical use,
and perhaps some notes on their implementation.  It is <code>scriptdoc</code>'s
job to extract this info and create a nice overview.  This can
then be used as a quick reference or manual.
<p>
Scriptdoc's job is to <em>suppress</em> implementation details.
The output is usually biased towards the users of a library script.
Noweb in turn targets other developers working on the code
which is included in its entirety.
<p>
<h3>HTML-Publish</h3>
<p>
J/Windows Release 4.03 comes with a code-to-HTML converter.  It
uses syntax-based colouring to create nice output according to
user-definable colour schemes.  One would typically use HTML-Publish
to save the generated output to separate web page which could then
be viewed by others.
<p>
<h3>vgrind</h3>
<p>
Vgrind is a traditional pretty-printing tool for the Unix nroff/troff
typesetting system.  Code fragments are embedded in the text within
<code>.vS</code>/<code>.vE</code> start and end lines.
<p>
Vgrind will then insert the appropriate font change instructions
to mark keywords, constants, and comments.  It detects these elements
guided by a short language description defining some patterns.
The patterns will also enable vgrind to collect an index for whatever
looks like a "procedure definition".  You can find such a vgrind
definition for J on juggle.gaertner.de .
<p>
The mixed documentation/code approach is not unlike the style used
in noweb sources, but I am not aware that people ever used this system
for literate programming.  That is, I never saw the practice
or recommendation to extract just the code for further processing.
Most often vgrind is simply run on original code files without
any additional text or <code>.vS</code>/<code>.vE</code> delimiters, with the
pretty-printed output directly sent to the printer.  This use is
not much different from "HTML Publish".
<p>
<h3>The J Project Manager</h3>
<p>
The J Project Manager is not a tool concerned with documentation
in any way.  There is a reason why I am including it in this short
list of comparisons: both the Project Manager and noweb can be used
to create J scripts to be shipped to a customer.
<p>
The Project Manager usually takes the J script files belonging to
the project and merges them together with the required standard
library scripts into one single J script executable by a J Runtime
system.  Even when the code is not encrypted, the customer will
have a hard time to exploit the code on his own:  All comments have
been stripped off, and the organisation as one huge script doesn't
exactly invite you to make any changes.  If you want to convince
yourself, try to modify one of the PM-generated scripts in the
standard library distributed with the system.  You will quickly
recognise that this is no fun at all.
<p>
Noweb's <code>notangle</code> can be used to the same effect:  As a developer,
you can maintain the code nicely organised and including excellent
documentation.  When you ship it off-site, you have the option
whether you want to include the documentation (converted into classic
<code>NB.</code> comments) and whether you want to keep the script organisation
modular or not.
<p>
Another typical task of the PM is to compile a number of source
scripts and referenced library scripts into a single runtime script.
With noweb, you have some freedom how noweb input files relate to
extracted J scripts.  It is up to you which nodes you will extract
into a script file.  You could distil several script files from
one noweb file, keep a one-to-one relationship, or collect the code
from different noweb files into a single script.
<p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Using noweb with J was simple to arrange, easy to learn, and
straightforward to use.  What I appreciate most of noweb is its
minimal-fuzz approach to switching between code and documentation.
I fell in love with the <code>[[embedded code]]</code> markers which are so
much less obtrusive to my eyes than the <code>\verb'foo'</code> or
<code>&lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt;</code> or <code>\fIbaz\fP</code> markups known from other
systems I used before to write articles.
<p>
I am a bit unsure at this moment where to draw the line between
<code>NB.</code> comments as part of the code as opposed to comments
as part of the additional documentation.  My gut feeling is that
only little paragraph headers and small hints "at the coding level"
would remain as <code>NB.</code> comments.
<p>
I didn't use noweb beyond the toy level yet.  My biggest nowebbed
project has a whopping three J scripts.
It yet remains to be seen whether programmers with Real Projects
benefit from noweb.  Would a developer team be happier one day
with jumping around in the HTML rendition than with, say, traditional
"tags" in the editor?  The functionality is the same, but many
people value a visually nice appearance highly.  Other topics
of my future investigations will be noweb's interaction with other
supporting tools.  For example, this article is written with
noweb, too.  [<i>Ed: to produce HTML: the HTML-to-World conversion
was done the old-fashioned way...</i>].
It is also version-controlled, and its most current
HTML rendition as well as its output scripts should be available
at the juggle server any time.
<p>
One thing is certainly clear:  noweb is fine for writing articles
on J.  I always have to improve or fix my code when writing an
article.  With noweb, I am doing the corrections in a single place
<a name="NWD6">and I can be sure that the code printed in the article will actually</a>
run and not be ruined by any transcription errors.
