N The Dictionary of J
T
 J is a dialect of APL, a formal imperative language.
 Because it is imperative, a sentence in J may also be
 called an _(instruction)_, and may be _(executed)_ to
 produce a _(result)_.  Because it is formal and
 unambiguous it can be executed mechanically by a
 computer, and is therefore called a
 _(programming language)_.  Because it shares the
 analytic properties of mathematical notation, it is
 also called an analytic language.
 
 APL originated in an attempt to provide consistent
 notation for the teaching and analysis of topics
 related to the application of computers, and developed
 through its use in a variety of topics, and its
 implementation in computer systems [1-5].
 
 J is implemented in C (as detailed in Hui [6]), and is
 ported to a number of different host computer systems.
 The effect of the specific host is minimal and
 communication with it is confined to the single
 _(foreign conjunction)_ detailed in the appendix.  See
 help files for other host facilities such as Windows.
 
 The Introduction in this book provides guidance to
 beginners.  References [7-9] use J in the exposition
 of various mathematical topics.
