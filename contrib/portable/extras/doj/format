Format of the dictionary.txt files

Lines starting with the character '#' in column 1 are comments
and completely ignored.  They are intended to point out
editorial changes, arguable layout etc.

Each entry is a paragraph, beginning with an "N" section
and terminated be an empty line.

A paragraph is a sequence of sections.  A section starts with a
code character in column 1.

Some code letters are followed by a space and the
contents in the rest of the line.

Other code letters are followed by several lines of material which
is then indented with a space.  Empty lines within such material
still have their space in column 1 in order not to break the entry's
paragraph.

Code Letters

N Name of the entry

	The name is capitalized, as in "Item Amend".

M symbol
D symbol
A symbol (+argument)
C symbol (+argument(s))
P symbol
F [x] 3!:5 y
I symbol (=. or =:)
U symbol

	Monad, dyad, adverb, conjunction, punctuation, foreign,
	"Is", and "unclassified" with respect to the above.

	There is no "V" for "verb".  M and D are used instead.
	However, M and D are not used for !:-derived verbs.
	In these cases, "F" entries are used.

	Adverbs and conjunctions are often shown with different
	arguments in the Dictionary, such as    m}  u} We continue
	this practice here, in particular since the Rank spec often
	depends on it.  To ease automated lookups, we require that,
	for 'C mumble',   ~.(;:mumble)-. <"0 'mnuvxy()' returns
	something suitable for a lookup.

R (derived) rank(s)

	A one, two, or three element spec "as usual", possibly
	referring to "mu" etc.  The most complicated is for
	Cut:  _ 1/2 _

T
	[multi-line, markup]
	The proper definition of the item, ie. the whole text
	of the Dictionary entries as for J versions 1 - 7, or
	the boxed parts starting with J Release 2.  Also, all
	of the text material in Parts I and II.

	The text is written as a sequence of (internal) paragraphs
	which are considered to be reformatted (but are, by and
	large, reasonably pre-formatted for to width of roughly 55
	characters).  Any post-processing *must* preserve the empty
	lines separating the paragraphs.  Internal one-line paragraphs
	are also used were line breaks need to be forced, for
	example for an enumeration.  There are no special constructs
	for things like tables, and single-line paragraphs are
	often used as a poor but working substitute.

	There are a few special bracket schemes for easy text
	markup, though:

	Embedded J phrases, even just a single "y", have to be
	quoted using double brackets, as in [[#y]].
	The double bracket is set off from the phrase with a space
	if a similar bracket borders the phrase, as in [[# * ] ]].

	Italic text from the Dictionary is transcribed using
	"*(mumble)*" where emphasis is intended and "_(mumble)_"
	where a special term is defined or used.

	These bracket constructs must not span across lines.
	Furthermore, none of the brackets appear in the running
	text.  (Where necessary, a text such as "(5+3)*(5-3)"
	was rewritten (e.g., into "(5+3) * (5-3)").)

	The text is strictly 7-bit ASCII.  Special characters such
	as Section signs or bullets have been rewritten.  For
	example, "<=>" is used (throughout) as the sign for "is
	equivalent to".

	Likewise, the layout of the text was adopted to
	this simple text format:

	Side-by-side constructs have been "serialized".  Most
	importantly, the parallel boxes for a monad and dyad
	definition are affected by this; two separate but neighboured
	entries are now used.  The hints and examples following
	both boxes have been split or duplicated for the monad and
	dyad as appropriate.  The split was the favored solution,
	but when a split would destroy the illustration of a concept,
	the entire example would rather be duplicated.

	Beyond this reordering, examples have not been changed; in
	particular, phrases demonstrating both the dyadic and
	monadic application of a verb have been left untouched and
	were duplicated.

	Comments next to code have been rewritten into
	"NB." comments.


E
	[multi-line]
	A series of example J phrases, without the computed answers.
	The answers are supposed to be provided by post-processing
	from/with J.

	Each entry starts "from a clean slate".  Definitions can be
	made in one E section and used in the next, as long as they
	are in the same "N" entry.  The standard library is not assumed,
	the examples may demonstrate errors, and even create files.

	E sections can appear both together with T or C sections.

H
	[multi-line, markup]
	Further hints, remarks, and comments for the entry, as
	found after the boxes.  The first H section terminates the
	T+E reference section(s).  Sometimes an empty H section is
	used to separate further Examples from the reference T+E
	sections.

|	[multi-line, no markup]
|	displays of tabular material
|	or "ascii art" is written
|	using styles in the first
|	column.
|	During output, spaces are
|	retained and a constant-width
|	font is to be used.
|	Displays can appear with T and H sections.

Order and repetitions

	N		exactly once
	[MDACFPIU]	once typically, but not at all
			for the informal Chapters/Sections
			(mostly of Parts I + II).
	R		once for MDAC
	T { E|T ...}	mandatory
	H { E|H ...}	optional
