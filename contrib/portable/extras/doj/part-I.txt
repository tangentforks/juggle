N Part I: Alphabet and Words
T
 The alphabet is standard ASCII, comprising _(digits)_,
 _(letters)_ (of the English alphabet), the
 _(underline)_ (used in names and numbers), the (single)
 _(quote)_, and others (which include the space) to be
 referred to as _(graphics)_.  Alternative spellings for
 the _(national use)_ characters (which differ from
 country to country) are discussed under _(Alphabet)_
 ([[a.]]).
 
 Numbers are denoted by digits, the underbar (for
 negative signs and for infinity and minus infinity --
 when used alone or in pairs), the period (used for
 decimal points and *(necessarily)* preceded by one or
 more digits), the letter e (as in [[2.4e3]] to
 signify [[2400]] in exponential form), and the letter
 j to separate the real and imaginary parts of a complex
 number, as in [[3e4j_0.56]].  Also see the discussion
 of _(Constants)_.
 
 A numeric _(list)_ or _(vector)_ is denoted by a list
 of numbers separated by spaces.  A list of ASCII
 characters is denoted by the list enclosed in single
 quotes, a pair of adjacent single quotes signifying the
 quote itself: [['can''t']] is the five-character
 abbreviation of the six-character word [['cannot']].
 The _(ace)_ [[a:]] denotes the boxed empty list
 [[<$0]].
 
 _(Names)_ (used for pronouns and other surrogates, and
 assigned referents by the copula, as in
 [[prices=: 4.5 12]]) begin with a letter and may
 continue with letters, underlines, and digits.  A name
 that ends with an underline or that contains two
 consecutive underlines is a _(locative)_, as discussed
 in Section II.I.
 
 A _(primitive)_ or _(primary)_ may be denoted by a
 single graphic (such as [[+]] for _(plus)_) or by a
 graphic modified by one or more following
 _(inflections)_ (a period or a colon), as in [[+.]] and
 [[+:]] for _(or)_ and _(nor)_.  A primary may also be
 an inflected name, as [[e.]] and [[o.]] for
 _(membership)_ and _(pi times)_.  A primary cannot be
 assigned a referent.
