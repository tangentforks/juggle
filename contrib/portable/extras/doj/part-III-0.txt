N Part III: Definitions
T
 Each main entry in the body of the dictionary is
 headed by a line beginning with the informal name of
 the monadic case of the function, and ending with the
 informal name of the dyadic case.  The line also
 contains the formal name of the function, consisting
 of one character or two, the last of which is a period
 or a colon.  In the case of a conjunction, the formal
 name is preceded by [[m]] or [[u]] (denoting a noun or
 verb argument) and is followed by [[n]] or [[v]].  An
 adverb has no symbol to its right.
 
 The three ranks (in the order _(monadic)_, _(left)_,
 and _(right)_) are also indicated, using the symbol
 [[_]] for an infinite (unbounded) rank, and with ranks
 dependent on the ranks of argument verbs shown as
 [[mu]], [[lv]], etc.
 
 Examples are provided with each definition, and the
 more complex of them may use auxiliary functions as
 yet unfamiliar.  These examples may be approached by
 ignoring all but the immediately relevant aspects of
 such auxiliaries, and by examining (and perhaps
 entering for execution) component phrases that can be
 used to build up the final result.
 
 For example, in the discussion of the adverb [[/]],
 the sentences below display various uses of it for
 convenient comparison:
E
 x=: 1 2 3 4 5 [ y=: 7 5 3
 (,.x);(x+/y);y;(x*/y);(+/y);(*/y)
T
 Even if the auxiliary functions [[;]] and [[,.]] are
 unfamiliar, their relevant effects are probably
 evident; if not, they may be clarified by the
 following experiments:
E
 x;y
 ,.7 8
 $,.7 8
T
 Although a name (such as _(foreign)_ for [[!:]]) is
 suggested for each word, others can be used in
 addition to or instead of them.  Thus, _(joy)_ might
 be used for [[!]] since the exclamation mark derives
 from an I placed above an o, an abbreviation of the
 Latin _(io)_.  Similarly, _(iota)_ might be used
 instead of _(integers)_ and _(index of)_ for [[i.]].
