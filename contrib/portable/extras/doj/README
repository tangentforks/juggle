This is a straight ASCII edition of the

	Dictionary of J
	by K.E.Iverson and R.K.W.Hui

It is a transcription from the printed edition for J Release 4,
published 1998 by Iverson Software Inc., ISBN 1-895721-15-6.

The design of the ASCII text format and the sample postprocessors
are copyrighted (C) 1999 by M. Neitzel.  The transcription as made
by M. Neitzel is derived work from the printed edition and all rights
remain reserved with Iverson Software Inc. and M. Neitzel.


The purpose of this edition is to serve as a basis for derived
works.  The format of the text is designed to be easily processed
into other forms for presentation, be it in whole or in part.


As of now, it is the Dictionary proper, that is, the Parts I, II,
and III, including the Appendix describing all facilities derived
from the Foreign conjunction (!:).  Not included are the the parts
"Introduction" and "Sample Topics", since these do not contain
reference material (and have historically been separate publications
anyway.)

The current processors are all awk(1) scripts.  Naturally, we would
prefer J scripts because that would make them portable to all platforms
where J runs.  Also, J is required to expand any embedded examples.
