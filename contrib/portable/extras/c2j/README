c2j is a tool to deal with C structures (and aggregate data types
in general) in J programs.  The approach here uses an extendable
hierarchy of type definitions.

This material was first released in the "Vector" Volume 16, No. 2:
Martin Neitzel:  "A Very Simple Structure Compiler for J"

The c2j.nw file is a noweb file containing both the code and the
documentation.  You have to use "noweb" to create both derived
outputs.  Find out more about using J with noweb in the j-noweb
directory next to this one.
