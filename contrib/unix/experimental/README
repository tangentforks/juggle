The material here is considered to be not even alpha-quality.  Use
at your own risk.  Everything here should be eventually moved to
some other place in the repository once it is deemed usable by
other persons by just the authors of the code.

The only reason to provide this non-public material in this public
space is to allow coders and beta-testers easy access to the code.
Once the material has "gone public" in some other directory, it
will be removed here.  Don't be surprised by empty directories with
all files in the CVS "attic".  One example was the genesis of the
"jmf" Unix support.

Release engineering and beta-testing will be based on tags and
branches if needs be.  Needs be.
