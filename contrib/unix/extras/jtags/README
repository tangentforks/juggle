jtags

A "tags" file is an index for global symbols.  Many Unix editors
allow you to jump around from symbol to symbol if such a file
is present.  You don't have remember yourself what hides where.
This file creates "vi"-flavoured tag files.  Emacs-style "TAGS"
files have a different format (currently not supported).

Use "jtags" to index your projects or the entire standard script library.

If you have a vintage UNIX which is not yet posixly correct, make sure
that the script refers to some "new awk" variation (nawk, gawk, mawk).
