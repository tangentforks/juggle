The files here support various Unix editors.

VIM:

ijs.vim		is a file describing J's syntax including a colouring scheme
		for the VIM (Vi IMproved) vi(1) clone, and
mysyntax.vim	is the file taking care of its activation.  See the "syntax"
		chapter in the vim documentation.


Emacs:		ijs- and ijx-major-modes would be great.  Any takers?
		The upcoming J release will have a J binary _without_
		built-in readline, so it wouldn't get into the way
		with emacs' line editing facilities.
