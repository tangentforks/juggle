Welcome to the CVS demo project!

Please add your own stanza to the limerix.ijs script.

Each stanza is started by a line with an asterisk (*).
In case you happen to know this funny programming language
called J and want to improve the code:  please keep it portable
across platforms.

To get notified of later commits, you can add your email address
to the file poets.  One line per address.

You would then get notified about further commits then, in
particluar of new limericks if the testers here are kind.

DOs and and DON'Ts:

Not many, really.  But some:

(1)  Don't lock files too long by doing a "cvs edit".
You should resolve such a lock after the testing again,
either by doing a "cvs commit" (normal) or "cvs unedit"
(bail out making any changes undone).

(2)  If you are smart, then you won't molest registered
"poets" with dozens of test commits.  They way to do
is a project on its own:

	- check out "people".
	- edit and "cvs commit people" so that only your address
	  is listet.
	- do your gazillions of cvs execises.
	- afterwards, restore "poets".  A "cvs diff -D yesterday poets"
	  will  remind you what you had deleted in the beginning.

(3)  And finally, I reminder to the most important DO:
     Please DO donate a limerick!
