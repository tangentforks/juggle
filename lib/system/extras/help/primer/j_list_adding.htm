<TR valign="baseline"><TD><H1>J way of adding lists</h1><TR><TD>

<P>J knows how to do things to single numbers, but it also knows how to do things with lists.</P>

<P>Since J knows how to add lists, you can write a third, simpler version of the definition.</P>

<PRE>addb =: 4 : 'x. + y.'
</PRE>
<P>Add this definition to your temporary script file, run the script, and test it.</P>

<PRE>   2 3 4 addb 4 5 6
6 8 10</PRE>

<P>At this point you probably realize that <TT>addb </TT>is so simple as to be unnecessary.</P>

<PRE>   2 3 4 + 4 5 6
6 8 10</PRE>

<P>In J you can just add the lists of numbers because the <TT>+</TT> verb knows all about lists of numbers.</P>

<P>Years of research and thought have gone into how J verbs work with lists. For example, if you wanted to add 1 to each number in a list.</P>

<PRE>   1 adda 2 3 4
3
</PRE>
<P>The Basic style <TT>adda </TT>verb gives an answer, but it is the wrong answer. What happens is that the <TT>while.</TT> uses the count of the left argument (which is 1) to determine how many elements to generate in the result, and so calculates only the first result number.</P>

<PRE>   2 3 4 adda 1
¦index error
¦   r=.r,(i{x.)+(i    {y.)</PRE> 

<P>This gives an error because the <TT>while.</TT> uses a count of 3 (the count of numbers in the left argument) but the right argument doesn't have that many so you get an error.</P>

<P>But the J<TT> +</TT> handles both these cases the way you would like, and would expect!</P>

<PRE>   1 + 2 3 4
3 4 5

   2 3 4 + 1
3 4 5</PRE>

<P>Thank goodness the <TT>addlists </TT>and <TT>adda </TT>verbs are in a temporary file and are easy to get rid of, because clearly you don't need them in J. Close and delete that temporary script now.</P>

<P>The simple concept of working with lists, instead of just single things, extends throughout J.</P>

<PRE>   2 4 6 * 7 8 9
14 32 54

   2 * 2 3 4
4 6 8

   2 3 4 * 2
4 6 8

   5 6 7 % 2
2.5 3 3.5

   2 3 4 - 3
_1 0 1</PRE>

<P>It works for the comparatives as well.
</P>
<PRE>   2 3 4 = 7 3 8
0 1 0

   2 < 0 1 2 3 4 5
0 0 0 1 1 1

   't' = 'testing'
1 0 0 1 0 0 0</Pre>

<P>If this works for primitives, what about verbs such as <TT>centigrade</TT>?
</P>
<P>Run your cf.ijs script to define your verbs and see what happens.
</P>
<PRE>   centigrade _40 32 212
_40 0 100</PRE>

<P>You can apply your <TT>centigrade </TT>verb to a list of numbers and get a list of results. This also work for <TT>fahrenheit</TT>.</P>

<PRE>   fahrenheit _40 0 100
_40 32 212

<P>What about your dyad convert? 
</P>
   'c' convert _40 32 212
_40 0 100

   'f' convert _40 0 32 100 212
_40 32 89.6 212 413.6</PRE>

<P>The extension of verbs to work consistently on lists is very powerful and significantly distinguishes J from most other languages. It is important that you assimilate this into the way you think about solving problems.</P>
