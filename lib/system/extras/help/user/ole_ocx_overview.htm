<TR valign="baseline"><TD><H1>OLE &amp; OCX Overview</h1>
<TR><TD colspan="2"> 



<P>
OLE allows client programs to access server programs, enabling integration between a variety of software components. All OLE servers are usable by all OLE clients. 

<P>
An OCX control, also known as an ActiveX control, or Microsoft Custom Control, is a special form of OLE control. The main difference is that OCX controls cause events, and are <I>in-process</I> server objects (DLL) whereas OLE controls are <I>local-server objects</I> (EXE).

<P>
Both OLE and OCX controls are application packages that can be accessed in a simple and consistent way from other Windows applications. 

<P>
J Win95/NT supports OLE and OCX, enabling J to be used both as a calculation server and as a client for other Windows software such as Visual Basic and Excel. In particular, OLE makes it very easy to add the power of J to other applications.

<P>
<B>OLE</B><br>
A key part of OLE is that a server can run in the same task, or as a separate task, or even as a separate task on another network connected machine. A server in the same task is an <I>in-process server</I>, a server in another task on the same machine is a <I>local server</I>, and a server on another machine is a <I>remote server</I>. An in-process server is the most efficient; the task can call the in-process server's routines almost as efficiently as its own routines.

<P>
Servers provide functions, called <I>methods</I>, that can be accessed by a client. For example, the J server provides a method <code>Do</code> which executes a J sentence; and a method Get which retrieves the value of a variable. If a client runs the method <code>Do'x=. 3+5'</code>, this causes the sentence to be executed in the J server. The client can then call method <code>Get</code> to retrieve the value of <code>x</code>.

<P>
<I>OLE Automation</I> is an interface supported by many clients and servers. OLE Automation gives a client an interface to a server that mimics the server's end-user interface. This allows a client to automate what would otherwise have to be done manually by a user. Although this is useful, the real power comes when the server has a general purpose programming environment that can be used to build complex services that can be used from a client. OLE Automation then provides easy access from the client to the full power of the server.

<P>
J supports OLE Automation as follows:<br><br>

<B><I>J OLE Automation server</I></B>. There are two servers: <br>
<li><I> JDLLServer</I> is an in-process J server 
<li><I> JEXEServer</I> is a local J server

<P>
<B><I>J OLE Automation client</I></B>. This supports servers such as Excel, that provide an OLE Automation interface to an application object that supports macro execution.
