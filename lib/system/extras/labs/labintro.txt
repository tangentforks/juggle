Lab Section Windows
A lab may be run entirely in the J session, or with the
comments in a window and the J sentences shown in the
session.

through the comment text, without advancing the lab.

J sentences are shown separated by a line beginning with a ).

Lab Section Normal Session
Other than the automatic execution when you advance to the
next section, this is a completely open and normal J
session.

Between sections you are in control and can use the J system
as normal. You are encouraged to experiment by entering your
own J sentences while going through labs.

You can edit and re-enter any J sentence by moving the cursor
up to the sentence, and pressing Enter to bring a copy down
to the current line.
