<TR valign="baseline"><TD><H1>z locale</h1><TR><TD>


<P>The <TT>z</TT> locale is the <EM>parent locale</EM> of all other locales.
</P>
<P>If a name is not found in the current locale, and there is a definition for it in the <TT>z</TT> locale, then that definition is used as if it were in the current locale.</P>

<P>The <TT>z</TT> locale is for common utilities that you want to be available everywhere. From the <TT>z</TT> locale, they are available for execution in any locale as if they were in that locale, yet there is only a single copy, and the names in the z locale don't clutter up the names in the other locales.</P>

<P>The profile.ijs that runs when you start J defines many standard utilities in the <TT>z</TT> locale. You have used both the erase and the names verbs which are defined in the <TT>z</TT> locale. You can tell this by the following:</P>

<PRE>   names 3	NB. verbs in the base locale
...
</PRE>
<P>The above does not list names as a name, yet you are able to execute it. This is because when it is not found in the base locale, its definition from the <TT>z</TT> locale is used as if it were in fact defined in the base locale.</P>

<PRE>   names_z_ 3	NB. verbs in z locale
...
</PRE>
<P>The result is too long to list here. The verb names has a dyadic definition that takes a left argument which indicates the first letter of names to return.</P>

 
<PRE>    'n' names_z_ 3
nameclass namelist names nc nl
</PRE>
<P><TT>names </TT>is defined in the <TT>z</TT> locale and that is the definition that is executed.</P>
