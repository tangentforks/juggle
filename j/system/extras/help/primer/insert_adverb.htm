<TR valign="baseline"><TD><H1>Insert adverb</h1><TR><TD>

<P>A <TT>/</TT> is referred to as insert if it is applied to a verb and the derived verb is then used monadically. The derived verb applies itself monadically by inserting the original verb between the items of the argument.</P>

<PRE>   sumover =. +/
</PRE>
<P>The adverb <TT>/</TT> takes the verb argument on its left, which is <TT>+</TT>,  and creates a new verb named <TT>sumover</TT>.</P>

<PRE>   sumover 7 5 10
22</PRE>

<P>The items of the argument <TT>7 5 10</TT> are the three atoms <TT>7</TT>, <TT>5</TT>, and <TT>10 </TT>and the definition of <TT>sumover </TT>is that it inserts its original verb between the items of the argument.</P>

<PRE>   7 + 5 + 10
22

   sumover i. 8
28</PRE>

<P>What if you do this to a table?
</P>
<PRE>   a =. i. 2 3
 
   a
0 1 2

   sumover a
3 5 7</PRE>

<P>Interesting, but let's take a closer look. The items of a are the two lists <TT>0 1 2</TT> and <TT>3 4 5</TT>. The verb <TT>sumover </TT>is defined to put the <TT>+</TT> (the original argument of <TT>/</TT>) between the items of its argument.</P>

<PRE>   0 1 2 + 3 4 5
3 5 7
</PRE>
<P>What if there were more rows?
</P>
<PRE>   a=. i. 3 4
   a
0 1  2  3
4 5  6  7
8 9 10 11

   sumover a
12 15 18 21
</PRE>
<P>The items of a are the three lists and with the <TT>+</TT> inserted between them you have:</P>

<PRE>   0 1 2 3 + 4 5 6 7 + 8 9 10 11
12 15 18 21
</PRE>
<P>The verb <TT>sumover </TT>applied to a table gives the sum over the columns. What if you wanted the sum over the rows?</P>

<PRE>   sumover"1 a
6 22 38
</PRE>
<P>The above is worth thinking about. First give your new verb a name to make it easier to talk about.</P>

<PRE>   sumrows =. sumover"1
   sumrows a
6 22 38
</PRE>
 
<P>Look up <TT>/</TT> in the J Dictionary and note that the rank information is<TT> _ _ _ </TT>. The rank information for an adverb gives the rank of the derived verb. So, sumover has monadic rank <TT>_</TT> (unbounded). The verb sumover applies to its entire argument and so inserts its original verb of <TT>+</TT> between the items of the argument.</P>

<P>The verb <TT>sumrows </TT>has monadic rank 1 and applies to the 1-cells of its argument. It is applied to each of the 1-cells of the argument, giving a partial result, and these partial results are then assembled into the result frame. Instead of the entire argument being fed to the verb <TT>sumrows</TT>, 1-cells are fed in, so sumrows inserts<TT> +</TT> between the items of the 1-cells. The 1-cells of the table argument are the rows of the table, so the <TT>+</TT> is inserted between the items of the rows. Visually:</P>

<PRE>sumrows   0 1 2 3	(first 1-cell)	gives  6
sumrows   4 5 6 7	(next 1-cell)	gives  22
sumrows   8 9 10 11	(next 1-cell)	gives  38
</PRE>
<P>The partial results of <TT>6</TT>, <TT>22</TT>, and <TT>38 </TT>are then assembled into the list result.</P>

<P>What about a rank 3 argument?
</P>
<PRE>   a =. i. 2 3 4
   a
 0  1  2  3
 4  5  6  7
 8  9 10 11

12 13 14 15
16 17 18 19
20 21 22 23

   sumover a
12 14 16 18
20 22 24 26
28 30 32 34</PRE>

<P>The items are the two tables and putting the + between them gives the result. Because this is the sum over the items, and in this case is the sum over the tables of a rank 3 array,  it can be described as the sum over the planes of the array.</P>

<P>The name sumover was used because it made it clearer in the beginning what was being done. In practice it is probably better to just use the primitives directly.</P>

<PRE>   a =. i. 2 3 4
   +/ a	NB. sum over planes
12 14 16 18
20 22 24 26
28 30 32 34

   +/"2 a	NB. sum over tables
12 15 18 21
48 51 54 57

   +/"1 a	NB. sum over rows
 6 22 38
54 70 86</PRE>
