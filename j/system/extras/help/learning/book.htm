<A NAME=short> <H3>ABOUT THIS BOOK</H3></A> <p>
This book is meant to help the reader to learn
the computer-programming language J.
<p>
The book is intended to be read with enjoyment by
both the beginning programmer and the experienced programmer
alike.  The only prerequisite is an interest on the part of the
reader in learning a programming language.
<p>
The emphasis is on making the J language accessible to a wide
readership. Care is taken to introduce only one new idea at a time,
to provide examples at every step, and to make examples so simple
that the point can be grasped immediately.  Even so, the experienced
programmer will find much to enjoy in the radical simplicity
and power of the J notation.  
<p>
The scope of this book is the core J language common to the many
implementations of J available on different computers. The coverage
of the core language is meant to be relatively complete, covering 
(eventually) most of the J Dictionary.
<p>
(Hence the book does not cover topics such as graphics, plotting, GUI, 
and database access covered in the J User Guide. 
It should also be stated what the aims of the book are not: neither 
to teach principles of programming as such, nor to study algorithms, 
or topics in mathematics or other subjects using J as a vehicle, 
nor to provide definitive reference material.) 
<p>
The book is organised as follows.  Part 1 is an elementary introduction 
which touches on a variety of themes. The aim is to provide the reader, 
by the end of part 1, with an overview and a general appreciation of the 
J language. The themes introduced in Part 1 are then developed in more 
depth and detail in the remainder of the book.
