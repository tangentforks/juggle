<TR valign="baseline"><TD><H1>Project Manager</h1>
<TR><TD colspan="2"> 


<P>
The Project Manager lets you work with project files. Run the Project Manager from menu Edit|Project Manager... or by pressing Ctrl-B.

<P>
From the Project Manager dialog, open a project file by either:

<P>
selecting from the Project list<br>
running menu File|New...<br>
running menu File|Recent...
<P>

<P>
The Project list shows all files with extension .ijp found in the Look In folder and its subfolders. If the project filename is the same as its folder name, for example, mygraph\mygraph.ijp, then only the filename is shown. 

<P>
You should set Look In to point to the folders (directories) where you are creating J projects. For example, the default Look In folder is user\projects. You might then create projects in directories such as user\projects\work, user\projects\test etc. 

<P>
You can define and modify the Look In folders by pressing the &gt;&gt; button. 

<P>
The menu File|Recent... shows the last 10 projects that have been loaded.

<P>
When a project is open, use Load to load the project on top of existing definitions. Select menu Project|Clean Load to reset the system, clearing out existing definitions, and then load the project.

<P>
Select Project|Clean Load Primaries to reset the system, and then load the project primary files only; this is useful for testing the final application. The verb loadp can also be used for this purpose.

<P>
Use menu Project|Build Options... to specify how the application is to be built. Use menu Project|Build Application to build the application.

<P>
<B>Notes</B><br>
The Notes editbox in menu File|Notes is for free-form comments. These comments are stored in the project file only, and do not appear in the final application.
