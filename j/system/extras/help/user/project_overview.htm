<P>
A <a href="project_file.htm">project file</a> lets you work with applications that are built from several scripts. You can specify which scripts are to be included in the application, which are required for development purposes only, and how the application is to be built. 

<P>
While the scripts are maintained individually during development, they can be compiled into a single output script for distribution/runtime/installation purposes. Alternatively, you can specify a build script that is run to create the final application, which may consist of several scripts.

<P>
The <a href="project_man.htm">Project Manager</a> lets you work with 
project files. Run the Project Manager from menu Run|Project Manager... 
or by pressing Ctrl-B.

<P>
Project files distinguish between scripts you write specifically for the project, and library scripts distributed with the system that are needed in the project. The project system automatically includes any files required by the scripts you specify. 

<P>
Typically all the files in a project, apart from library files, will be stored in a single directory, for example, a subdirectory of user\projects. Within the directory will be a project file, plus the project source scripts. 

<P>
The project facilities require that you adhere to various naming and coding <a href="project_conven.htm">conventions</a>.
