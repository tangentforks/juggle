README for interpreter directory
================================

The 'tests' directory contains test files for the stand-alone C interpreter
which is included in the UPS source.  See the README files in the directories
for details.


Documentation
-------------
The 'docs' directory contains documentation about the C interpreter,
more is in ../ups/docs.

 
Header files
------------
The 'include' directory contains versions of the standard header files which
can be used with the interpreter if the ones in /usr/include produce errors.


Running the interpreter
-----------------------
Note : the '-g' option is only required if you want to use UPS to debug the
".cx" executable produced by the interpreter.

To build single source applications use:

	cx  -I.  -g  -o <executable>  <sourcefile>

To build multiple source applications use:

	cx  -I.  -g  -o <executable>  <sourcefiles>
or
	cx  -I.  -g  -c <sourcefiles>
	cx  -I.  -g  -o <executable>  <ocxfiles>

To run single source files directly :

	cg  -I.  <sourcefile>

To run executable generated by CX above:

	xc  <executable>

To debug CX executables:

	ups  <executable>
