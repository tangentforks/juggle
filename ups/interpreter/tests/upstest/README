README for upstest directory
============================

This directory contains test files for the stand-alone C interpreter
which is included in the UPS source.

Running the tests
-----------------
run_tests	- Run tests using the headers in '../../include' 


Test programs
-------------
Following test programs are from the book C Programming Language. Most are
single source applications.  The name tells you which section to look for.

test_1.2a.c
test_1.2b.c
test_1.3.c
test_1.4.c
test_1.5.1a.c
test_1.5.1b.c
test_1.5.2a.c
test_1.5.2b.c
test_1.5.2c.c
test_1.5.2d.c
test_1.5.3.c
test_1.5.4.c
test_1.6.c
test_1.7.c
test_2.10.c
test_2.9.c

Following three sources have to linked to build the executable.

test_4.3a.c
test_4.3b.c
test_4.3c.c

(Sorry - the above tests are not included in the distribution as there may
 have been copyright problems).

Folowing test various aspects of the C language - some of them won't work
with UPS because of limitations in UPS (see notes elsewhere).

test_align.c
test_atof.c
test_atof2.c
test_double.c
test_enum.c
test_enum2.c
test_float_inc.c
test_hello.c
test_init.c
test_stdout.c
test_strlen.c
test_strlen2.c
test_struct.c
test_struct_assign.c
test_switch.c
test_time.c

Following programs need to be linked to form an executable.  This is a
sophisticated AVL Tree Manager - and UPS is able to run it !

alloc.c
alloc.h
avl3.h
avl3a.c
avl3b.c
avl3int.h
tavl3.c
(wordlist	- data for above application.)


test_decl.c	demonstrates some erroneous constructs that are caught.
test_decl2.c	should be successfully parsed/interpreted.
