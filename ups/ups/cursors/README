This directory contains the cursors used by ups, in X11 bitmap format.
All the cursors have a cursor file and a mask file.  The mask file
names are formed by adding "_mask" to the cursor file name.

If you want to change a cursor use bitmap to edit the file, then
say "make cursorfile" in the ups directory (.. from here).
