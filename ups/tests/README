README for ups tests
--------------------

By default only C test programs are built when you type 'make tests' in the
top-level directory.  To build the C++ or Fortran programs use "make cxx" or
"make fortran" in the 'tests' directory.

Information about the tests is contained in the source code.  Just run 'ups'
on the test program and the information should be displayed as a comment in
the source 'ups' has displayed, or at the top of the file.

Tests contributed by :
    Russell Browne <russ@amc.com> : 'register long long' and C++ template
    Michele Ferlauto <ferlauto@athena.polito.it> : Fortran "pippo2"

g77-u77-test.f is a test program provided with GNU 'g77'
