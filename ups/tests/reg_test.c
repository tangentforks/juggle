 *  Instructions
 *  ------------
 *  1) Put a breakpoints on the 'return()' call above.
 *  2) Press 'Start' and check all the variables.
 *     Use the 'Format' button to show as hex.
 *     Press 'Continue'
 *  3) Quit from 'ups' and just run the program with a parameter, and it
 *     should core dump.  If you don't get a core dump they may be disabled,
 *     this may fix it :
 *         ulimit -c unlimited
 *     and try again.
 *  4) Run 'ups' on the program and the core file.
 *     Look at the stack trace and the variables,
