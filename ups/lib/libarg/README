This directory contains the source code of the libarg library, which
implements shell-like command line parsing including globbing and
i/o redirection.

I'd like to turn this into a libshell.a so that all those textual
interactive programs could have shell history etc.  We're a long
way off that at present: for one thing there is no documentation
of the existing code.

This library is used by ups to parse the target command line in the
display area.
