This directory contains the source of the libmtrutil library, which
contains utility functions: things like a fast memory pool allocation
package (alloc_pool.c), random access to lines in a text file (so.c)
and generalised error message handling (mesgf.c).  This is where
header files like gendefs.h (containing project wide #defines like
TRUE and FALSE) live.

Unfortunately there is no documentation of the routines here other
than the comments in the source code.  Most of the routines are
fairly low level and short.
