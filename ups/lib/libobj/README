This directory contains the libobj library which does low level handling
of the ups display area.

The Obj library handles the layout and display of objects of different
types, with application provided callbacks to handle rendering and
input.

It is conceptually (very) roughly at the same level as the X toolkit.

There is an out of date description of this library and its interface
in doc/tech.ms.

I (Mark Russell) use this for two projects: ups and a graphical file
system browser, but the library has never been used by anyone else.
Consequently the documentation is rudimentary.  Also I wrote this code
before I knew about name space pollution - there is no library prefix.
Executive summary: don't try and use this stuff.
