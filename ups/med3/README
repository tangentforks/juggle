This is the source code for the med3 menu editor.  
Med3 was written by John Bovey, UKC, 26-4-93


I have added the med3 files to the standard ups distribution.
There is documentation under the med3/doc directory.
Use "make" to build the med3 menu editor. The menus in ups
are under ups/menus. You can use med3 to modify and create
new menus. Then in the ups/menus directory, use 

./GLUEMENUS *.c >../menudata.c

to update the master menu file. Any change in the menu identifiers
need to be manually edited in the ups/menudata.h file.
