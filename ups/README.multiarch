Building multiple versions of ups from a single source tree
-----------------------------------------------------------

This requires a 'make' program that supports VPATH, most recent ones
do, e.g. SunOS 4.1.x, Solaris 2.x, GNU make, BSD make.

You should also read the instructions in the README file which provides
more details on most of the steps, only step 2 is different.

WARNING - you cannot mix building in the source tree with building in
a different directory.  If you have already done a build in the source
tree, "cd" into it and type "make clean". 

1)  Unpack the distribution.
 
2)  Create the directory where ups will be built, change into that
    directory and run the 'configure' script located in the top ups
    directory.  E.g. for ups-3.34 unpacked in the current directory:

	mkdir sun4
	cd sun4
	../ups-3.34/configure

    NOTE - you *MUST* use a relative path to the configure script.

3)  Check the files created by 'configure' in this root directory :
	Makefile  ifdefs.h

4)  Just type:

	make  ups

    If all goes well this should build you a binary called ups/ups.
