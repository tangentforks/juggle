RFC 1866            Hypertext Markup Language - 2.0        November 1995

8.2.1. The form-urlencoded Media Type

   The default encoding for all forms is `application/x-www-form-
   urlencoded'. A form data set is represented in this media type as
   follows:

        1. The form field names and values are escaped: space
        characters are replaced by `+', and then reserved characters
        are escaped as per [URL]; that is, non-alphanumeric
        characters are replaced by `%HH', a percent sign and two
        hexadecimal digits representing the ASCII code of the
        character. Line breaks, as in multi-line text field values,
        are represented as CR LF pairs, i.e. `%0D%0A'.

        2. The fields are listed in the order they appear in the
        document with the name separated from the value by `=' and
        the pairs separated from each other by `&'. Fields with null
        values may be omitted. In particular, unselected radio
        buttons and checkboxes should not appear in the encoded
        data, but hidden fields with VALUE attributes present
        should.

            NOTE - The URI from a query form submission can be
            used in a normal anchor style hyperlink.
            Unfortunately, the use of the `&' character to
            separate form fields interacts with its use in SGML
            attribute values as an entity reference delimiter.
            For example, the URI `http://host/?x=1&y=2' must be
            written `<a href="http://host/?x=1&#38;y=2"' or `<a
            href="http://host/?x=1&amp;y=2">'.

            HTTP server implementors, and in particular, CGI
            implementors are encouraged to support the use of
            `;' in place of `&' to save users the trouble of
            escaping `&' characters this way.
